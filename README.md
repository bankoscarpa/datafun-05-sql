# datafun-05-sql
Week 5 Coursework

Learning SQL! 
Why did the SQL student bring a ladder to class?
Because they heard they needed to learn how to scale tables. ðŸªœðŸ“Š

CC5.2 Plan the Project / Gather Data
Database with Two Related Tables
First, we will create a simple database (book_db) with two related tables: books and authors. This first example will be guided and we'll all do the same thing. In the project this module, you'll create any two related tables (e.g. movies and directors) to implement a custom project. Be thinking what might be interesting! 

The books table might have the following fields - Note the naming conventions! 
book_id (the unique primary key for this table, a GUID)
title (simple string),
year_published (int)
author_id (foreign key), 
The authors table might have the following fields:
author_ id (the unique primary key for this table, a GUID)
first
last
You will read from data files, create your 2 tables, and then modify the books table to include an is_favorite field. 
Planning Our Project Organization
Both in our GitHub repo and on our machine, our root project repository folder will be datafun-05-sql, and we'll create subfolders for our SQL statements, our data files, and we'll keep our Python scripts in the root project folder (with the .gitignore, .venv, README.md, and requirements.txt).

â”œâ”€â”€ data/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ books.csv



 

Planning Your Data Sources
In the new example project, I use author and books records that look like the content below. If you use sample data with GUIDs or integer ids, just be sure your table columns match your data types.   We have so many skills now, we can read from CSV files, or JSON files, or use GUIDs or use IDs like these. 

At work, we'll encounter all kinds of things, so I'd rather leave it up to you to initialize your database as you like. You can use any two related one to many (1:M) you like. In this project, we assume that each book has exactly one author and that an author can have 0, 1, or more books (that is, one to many or 1:M).

-- Insert records into the authors table first
INSERT INTO authors (author_id, name, birth_year, nationality) VALUES
    ('AUTHOR_001', 'J.K. Rowling', 1965, 'British'),
    ('AUTHOR_002', 'George Orwell', 1903, 'British'),
    ('AUTHOR_003', 'Harper Lee', 1926, 'American');

-- Insert records into the books table
-- And include foreign key references to the authors table
-- IMPORTANT: No tic marks inside a string, use two single quotes to escape a single quote
INSERT INTO books (book_id, title, genre, publication_year, author_id) VALUES
    ('BOOK_001', 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer''s Stone', 'Fantasy', 1997, 'AUTHOR_001'),
    ('BOOK_002', 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'Fantasy', 1998, 'AUTHOR_001'),
    ('BOOK_003', '1984', 'Dystopian', 1949, 'AUTHOR_002'),
    ('BOOK_004', 'Animal Farm', 'Political Satire', 1945, 'AUTHOR_002'),
    ('BOOK_005', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Fiction', 1960, 'AUTHOR_003');

 

One common way to populate a database is from related CSV files.

For this, we typically create a data folder to hold the CSV files. You can create two CSV files in Excel with example data, or find a source, or use the book, or use this content below as you like. For example you could start with: 

authors.csv (example)

Save Your Work
After adding your folder and data files in VS Code, use git to add / commit / and push your content to GitHub. 

Schema Matters! 
The exact column types are important. If you use GUIDs in your sample data, when creating your SQLite table, you'll want to use a text field to hold that column.
